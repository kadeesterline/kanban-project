# KanBan

Kaban is an interactive to-do board that allows dragging-and-dropping of tasks into columns, keeping you on organized and on track to hit deadlines.

This is a joint project between Kade Esterline and Tywen Kelly made during their time at Flatiron School.

## How it works

Get a birds eye view of all your tasks in columns. Make custom columns for different stages and drag-and-drop tasks between them as you progress.

Edit a task to change details about it:s such as date, notes, and priority.

Every board is public. Join one to become a member and add tasks. Note that admins, the creator of the boards, retain certain priviledges, like editing the name of the board.
